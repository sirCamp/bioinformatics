# Bioinformatics - Tools for SAM files

This project is born as a university project in Python and R.

Python is used for the algorithm and R for the plot of the tracks.

The tools allows you to operate with the SAM file to get some data as:

+ Genome Insertion Lenght
+ Sequence Coverage
+ Physical Coverage
+ Kmers Counting and Identification

For the *Sequence Coverage* and *Physical Coverage* the output will be an **.wig** files.

This file can be explored with a Genome Browser as IGV that you can find here:
