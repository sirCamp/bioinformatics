\intro{This chapter talk about final results and consideration about the project}\\
\section{Results}

The obtained results are some structural variation found in the resequenced genome.
These structural variation are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{description}
		\item[Long deletion] a long deletion is visible between 1.380k bases and 1.400k bases, this deletetation is confirmed by sequence coverage
  \end{description}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{description}
		\item[Inversion] the inversion structural modification is visible between 1.745k bases and 1.770k bases
  \end{description}
\end{itemize}
